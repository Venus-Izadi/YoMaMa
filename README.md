# YoMaMa

In 2015, 1 in 4 expectant mothers were experiencing prenatal depression, and that’s why we are working on YoMaMa, which is targeting pregnant women with depression or anxiety issue.

As they can not take much medicines we tried to help them by giving them hope by building an app to strengthen the emotional bond between a mom and her child.
Mom (and Dad also) **get notifications** from baby to do **some actions** (like ‘Mama, Let’s go for a walk’) or informative details about baby’s growth.
